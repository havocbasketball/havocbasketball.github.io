  <h2>We can help you get better</h2>

  <p>The Havoc Team is for basketball players in club or school teams who want to take their skills to the next level.</p>

  <p>Your team trainings are focussed on learning set plays and learning to play together so your team can succeed. Which is awesome. However, there is little time available for developing or advancing your individual skills. It&#8217;s all about winning games.</p>

  <p>If you want to get better as a player your options are usually playing by yourself in the drive way or playing pick up games at the local gym. Now there&#8217;s a better way.</p>

  <h3>A better way</h3>
  <p>You can think of The Havoc Team as <em>after school tutoring for basketball</em>. We aren&#8217;t a club. We don&#8217;t want you to leave your current team and play for us. (We don&#8217;t even have a team for you to play for!) Instead we want to help you, your team and your coach by making you a better basketball player.</p>

  <p>Whether you&#8217;re trying to get selected for a top team, earn a scholarship or win a championship The Havoc Team can help you reach your goals.</p>

  <h3>Learn the modern style of play</h3>

  <p>To play at a higher level you need to know how to play the modern style of basketball game. These days the most successful teams focus on <em>pace and space</em>. We&#8217;ll show you how to adapt your game so that you&#8217;re comfortable scoring within this style of play and can defend against it.</p>

  <h3>Learn the latest techniques</h3>

  <p>To play the modern game you&#8217;ll also need to master a particular set of skills. (The same ones you see on TV). We&#8217;ll teach you skills like hopping into your shot, shooting step-back jumpers, using different types of screens to get open and how and when to attack.</p>

  <h3>Play at 100% all the time</h3>

  <p>Players at a higher level don&#8217;t run fast, they sprint. They jump higher, move stronger and think smarter. To play at their level you&#8217;ll need to get used to giving it all you&#8217;ve got, all of the time. That&#8217;s why we provide an environment where you&#8217;re always working at your maximum capacity regardless of your current skill level. Warning: this isn't for the fait hearted :)</p>

  <h3>Create a pathway to your goal</h3>

  <p>Whatever your basketball goals are only you can do the work to achieve them. But we&#8217;re here to help you discover the path to get there. If you dream of playing in division one, the NBL or overseas then we can point you in the right direction.</p>

  <h2>How The Havoc Team works</h2>

  <h3>There&#8217;s a more effective way to learn new skills. We&#8217;ll show you how.</h3>

  <p>When it comes to training, it&#8217;s not only what you learn, but how you learn it. Havoc training uses a proven training methodology to take you from performing small, simple actions in low-pressure situations to performing big, complex actions in high-pressure situations.</p>

  <h3>Whole</h3>

  <p>We start by showing you the big picture so you know where you&#8217;re trying achieve. You need to see how a particular action fits into a real game of basketball because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re training for.</p>

  <h3>Part</h3>

  <p>Next, instead of expecting you to do something new from end-to-end, we break a new action down into small steps. You practice one step at a time giving 100% effort. First you work individually, then with others, and then with some defence and then in a live game situation.</p>

  <h3>Whole</h3>

  <p>When you&#8217;ve mastered all the parts of the skill, we challenge you to put it all together again, giving 100% effort. We&#8217;ll compare what you can then do to the original demonstration and help you identify how you can improve.</p>

  <h3>Next Level</h3>

  <p>Doing the same three man weaves and shooting drills every week is boring. We provide a structured programme that works like the levels in a video game. You&#8217;ll stay motivated by always having a new skill to learn and new challenges to complete.</p>
